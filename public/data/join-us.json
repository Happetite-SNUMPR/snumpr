    "description": "The team's primary focus is to get you succeeded in your career path. Customizing to your interest, we try to help your way to reach the goal after you graduate the lab. Most of our team members are for academic positions (e.g., faculty, world class industry researchers) and a few are for engineering positions (e.g., world class software companies). We mostly aim for sharing our results in top venus in computer vision and machine learning (e.g., CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML) and contribute to open source softwares to benefit other researchers including ourselves."

We read papers, discuss with fellow students and faculty, implement them and come up with new ideas for the issues in the state of the arts. We welcome any crazy ideas to try and discuss among the team and the faculty is always open to discuss on anything."

Each graduate student will have a state of the art workstation equipped with one A6000 and a 39\" wide curved monitor for fast prototyping. We are equipped with roughly 80 GPU's (A6000 or 3090) (roughtly 6+ GPUs per person).\nWe are buying more!"
